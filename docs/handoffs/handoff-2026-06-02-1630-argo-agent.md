# Handoff — Vanta: all 7 PRD phases + interactive agent shell
Generated: 2026-06-02 ~16:30
Project: Vanta — `/Users/jasonpoindexter/Documents/GitHub/Vanta`
Branch: `main` (working tree clean, everything committed)

## What Was Accomplished
- **All 7 PRD phases built, integrated, green.** Each is one commit (clean rollback points).
  - 1 agent loop · 2A skills+memory · 2B web search · 3 browser/vision · 4 code/dev+Anthropic · 6 autonomous · 5 comms.
- **32 tools** registered; **290 tests** (16 Rust + 274 TS); typecheck clean.
- **Interactive agent shell** (the big one this session): `vanta` with no args launches a banner (logo, model, goals, all 32 tools, skills) + a chat REPL with persistent conversation — the Hermes/OpenClaw "straight-up agent" experience. Verified: banner renders, loop runs, `vanta run "list my goals"` works live on Ollama.
- **Launchers:** `./run.sh` (download-&-run: bootstraps kernel + deps on first run) and `./vanta` alias. Global `vanta` via `npm link` (symlink at `~/.hermes/node/bin/vanta`).
- **Flow map:** `docs/vanta-flow.md` — Hermes runtime flow as a Mermaid flowchart, mapped 1:1 to Vanta modules + a gap list.
- Docs kept current: root `CLAUDE.md`, `argo-ts/CLAUDE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `PARKED.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, project memory.

## Files Changed (this session, beyond the 7 phase commits)
| File | Status | What Changed |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `argo-ts/src/agent.ts` | Modified | Extracted `runTurn`; added `createConversation` (history persists across turns); `runAgent` now wraps it (behavior identical) |
| `argo-ts/src/session.ts` | Created | Shared run setup pulled out of cli.ts: `prepareRun`, `buildSummarizer`, `writeRunMemory`, `consoleCallbacks`, `approver` |
| `argo-ts/src/interactive.ts` | Created | `renderBanner` + `runChat` (the REPL) |
| `argo-ts/src/cli.ts` | Rewritten | `vanta` (no args) → `runChat`; imports from session.ts; slimmer |
| `argo-ts/bin/vanta.mjs` | Created | Global bin shim (spawns local tsx on cli.ts, inherits TTY) |
| `argo-ts/package.json` | Modified | Added `"bin": { "vanta": "bin/vanta.mjs" }` |
| `argo-ts/vitest.config.ts` | Created (Phase 6) | 20s testTimeout for TS-compiler LSP tests (flake fix) |
| `run.sh`, `vanta` | Created | Repo-root launchers |
| `docs/vanta-flow.md` | Created | Runtime flow map + gap list |

## Current State
- Build: **PASSING.** `cargo test` 16/16 · `npm test` 274/274 · `npm run typecheck` clean.
- Uncommitted changes: **NO** (clean tree on `main`).
- Kernel: running on `:7788` (auto-starts via the launcher if down).
- Provider: Ollama `qwen2.5:14b` default (no key). Live agent loop verified.

## In Progress (not finished)
- None mid-edit. Last completed unit: interactive shell + global command + flow map (commit `4704061`).

## Blocked / Needs Decision
- **`vanta` global on PATH** — symlink exists at `~/.hermes/node/bin/vanta` but that dir isn't on PATH. Jason must add it himself (I'm not allowed to edit `~/.zshrc`):
  `echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.hermes/node/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc`
  Until then, run from the repo: `./vanta` or `./run.sh`.
- **Skill/memory kernel-Allow classification** — flagged for veto in `DECISIONS.md` (not a bypass; `assess` still runs, returns Allow because describeForSafety is an internal-op constant).
- **Comms live use** — needs a one-time Google OAuth client (`VANTA_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET`) then `vanta auth google`. I can't provision the OAuth app (no Google account access). Code is real + offline-tested.

## Key Decisions Made (and Why)
1. **Built phase-by-phase via parallel workflows**, each: write contracts → fan-out build agents → serial integrate → verify-and-repair gate → commit + update both CLAUDE.md. Kept quality high and context low.
2. **`runAgent` kept as a thin wrapper over `createConversation`** so the REPL gets persistent history without changing one-shot behavior — all 274 tests stayed green.
3. **Direct integrations over MCP** for comms (googleapis-style via `google-auth-library` + fetch). MCP client is a deferred option (gap #6).
4. Full rationale list in `DECISIONS.md`.

## Exact Next Steps (in order) — from `docs/vanta-flow.md` gap list
1. [ ] **`vanta setup`** — first-run wizard (pick provider, set keys/model) instead of editing `.env`. (small)
2. [ ] **`vanta status` / `vanta doctor`** on the agent (TS) side — surface kernel + provider + store health. (small)
3. [ ] **Post-turn background review** — wire `skills/curator.ts` `curate()` into the loop's post-turn step (Hermes nudges memory/skill curation after each turn). (small)
4. [ ] **Sessions** — persist & resume full conversation transcripts (Hermes `sessions browse`). (medium)
5. [ ] **MCP client** — mount MCP servers (the banner's "MCP Servers" row). (medium, needs a decision vs owning each integration)
6. [ ] **Gateway/daemon mode** — `vanta gateway` background service. (medium)

Items 1–3 are small + high-impact on the "feels like a real agent" axis. Recommended next slice.

## Context That's Easy to Lose
- **Harness pins spawned cwd to the OLD `Nexarion Agent` path** (empty leftover dir). The real repo is `~/Documents/GitHub/Vanta`. `cli.ts findRepoRoot()` resolves via `import.meta.url` (not cwd), so the launchers work regardless. `VANTA_ROOT` exists for the same reason.
- **Stale binary on :7788** — if the kernel won't bind: `lsof -nP -iTCP:7788 -sTCP:LISTEN`, kill the PID.
- **Workflow tool gotcha:** scripts reject the literal tokens `Date.now()`/`new Date()`/`Math.random()` even inside prompt strings — phrase around them.
- **Live-use caveats** (real code, offline-tested only): browser → `npx playwright install chromium`; anthropic/vision → API keys; comms → OAuth client + consent; LSP is .ts/.tsx only; `vanta cron` needs an OS scheduler trigger. All in `PARKED.md`.
- Build via parallel agents worked well but integration must stay serial (no git-worktree isolation in this tree — concurrent edits to `tools/index.ts`/`cli.ts` would clobber).

## Continuation Prompt
Paste into a new Claude session to resume:

---
Resume work on **Vanta** at `/Users/jasonpoindexter/Documents/GitHub/Vanta` (branch `main`, clean tree). Vanta is a local trusted-operator agent: Rust safety kernel (`src/`, enforced boundary on :7788) + TypeScript agent layer (`argo-ts/`). Read `CLAUDE.md` (root) + `argo-ts/CLAUDE.md` + `docs/vanta-flow.md` first — they're the source of truth (file maps, env, the runtime flow, gaps).

State: **all 7 PRD phases done, 290 tests green** (16 Rust + 274 TS), typecheck clean. `vanta` (no args) launches an interactive banner + chat REPL — the agent works live on Ollama qwen2.5:14b. Run it with `./vanta` or `./run.sh` from the repo (global `vanta` needs `~/.hermes/node/bin` on PATH).

Verify baseline: `cargo test && (cd argo-ts && npm test && npm run typecheck)`.

Next slice (from `docs/vanta-flow.md` gap list, in order): (1) `vanta setup` first-run wizard, (2) `vanta status`/`doctor` on the TS side, (3) wire `skills/curator.ts curate()` into the loop's post-turn step, then (4) conversation sessions persist/resume. Items 1–3 are small + high-impact.

Build discipline (respect these): work per `docs/prd.md` + `DECISIONS.md` (don't re-litigate locked choices); each slice = real code + co-located vitest + `tsc --noEmit` clean + commit; files <300 lines, fns <50, zod at boundaries, errors-as-values in tools, ESM `.js` imports; every tool gated through the kernel `assess()`; never fabricate — flag what needs external setup (keys/OAuth/browser binaries) rather than fake it. Don't edit `~/.zshrc` or other shell profiles without explicit per-action approval. Promote deferred items from `PARKED.md`.
