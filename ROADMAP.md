# Vanta Roadmap — v0 (done) → v1

Source of truth for build order. One line moves between `[ ]`/`[~]`/`[x]` as slices land.
North star / why: [`MANIFESTO.md`](MANIFESTO.md). Vision + rationale: `docs/prd.md`.
Runtime flow: `docs/vanta-flow.md`. Locked choices: `DECISIONS.md`. Deferred: `PARKED.md`.

---

## Where we are

**v0/v1 = done.** All 7 original PRD phases and v1.1–v1.5 tracks shipped — agent loop,
skills+memory, web/reach, browser+vision, code/dev, autonomy primitives, comms,
operator systems, and the real Ink 7 TUI. Current generated catalogs contain **141 tools**
and **145 slash commands**. Last recorded full verify (2026-07-07):
**11979 TS tests** (1070 files), `tsc` clean, **67 kernel tests** green. Live status +
release log: root `CLAUDE.md` §Status and `CHANGELOG.md` (v0.8.0).

**v1 = "is a full personal agent".** v0 felt like scripts because the *experience and
self-improvement layer* is thin: no setup, no Gemini, no memory of past conversations,
nothing learns automatically, not reachable as a service. v1 closes that.

### Evolution ladder (2026-06-08 — full brief in `docs/evolution-brief.md`)

The bottleneck is no longer raw capability. It is coherence — Vanta knowing what it is
doing, what is blocked, and what closes loops before opening new ones.

| Level | Name | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | **Tool user** — reads, writes, runs, searches, gates through kernel | ✅ shipped |
| 2 | **Trusted operator** — knows goal before tool use, verifies output, labels uncertainty, durable brain | ✅ shipped |
| 3 | **Loop closer** — persistent task stack, context-switch detection, bias toward closure, "where do we stand?" | ✅ shipped |
| 4 | **Command infrastructure** — ambient awareness, life-wide search, proactive triage, world model | 🔜 horizon |

Level 3 shipped with EF-TASKSTACK, MEM-RELEVANCE, OPERATOR-DASHBOARD, AUTO-ROUTER, VISION-COMPARE.
Level 4 has started: world model, money, radar, teams, life-search, reach, verification locks,
self-repair, background agent CLI management, auto permission mode, `/init`, lifecycle init flags,
resume forking, Tab/Shift+Tab focus traversal, the opt-in TUI v2 mission-control shell, the Vite/React desktop renderer, per-tool permission request UIs, operator profile preferences, preference-signal capture, memory guardrails, per-task tool scoping, solutioning mode, and the opt-in runtime plugin framework are live slices; browser OS-level
control and deeper ambient channels remain horizon.

## Parity & differentiator epics — shipped (2026-07-11)

Triggered by the OpenClaw / Hermes head-to-head. These are **standing high-priority
asks** that had slipped because per-channel cards were marked *"out of scope for a
local operator."* That disposition was reversed and all three cards are now shipped.

- [x] **MSG-CHANNEL-PARITY** — reached Hermes(20+)/OpenClaw(13+) channel coverage. Umbrella
  over the `PlatformAdapter` pattern: Discord, Signal, iMessage, Matrix, Teams, Google
  Chat, email/SMS, and Slack. The old hosted Slack-app card was retired after this
  adapter-based parity slice shipped.
- [x] **VANTA-SELF-LEARNING-LOOP** — the Hermes wedge to *own*, not just match. One named,
  always-on closed loop: observe trajectory → propose skill/edit → eval-gate → adopt
  (gated) → measure reuse. Unifies the existing curator, meta-tune, LoRA, and brain layers.
- [x] **VANTA-MIGRATE** — `vanta migrate openclaw|hermes`: import skills + MCP servers +
  model config into `~/.vanta`, preview → select → backup → apply. On-pattern (both
  competitors ship importers). Pairs with the docs comparison page.

### Hermes transcript extraction (2026-07-11)

The Tonbis AI Garage Hermes transcript pass produced a newer set of workflow cards in
`roadmap.json`: `HERMES-PROFILE-ROSTER`, `HERMES-KANBAN-ROUTER`,
`HERMES-SECOND-BRAIN-CORPUS`, `HERMES-DELEGATION-TREE-RECEIPTS`,
`HERMES-TOOL-SURFACE-PROFILES`, `HERMES-WEBHOOK-WORKFLOW-BUILDER`,
`HERMES-SPREADSHEET-COPILOT`, `HERMES-VAULT-SECRETS-ROTATION`, and
`HERMES-DASHBOARD-PLUGIN-SLOTS`. The current Hermes feature/function harvest added
`HERMES-PROFILE-DISTRIBUTIONS`, `HERMES-AUTOMATION-BLUEPRINT-CATALOG`,
`HERMES-CONTEXT-REFS-V2`, `HERMES-CREDENTIAL-POOLS`, `HERMES-PLUGIN-LLM-LANE`, and
`HERMES-DELIVERABLE-AUTO-ATTACH`. The live issue + Mercury + user-story pass added
`HERMES-ISSUE-REGRESSION-PACK`, `HERMES-STORY-EVAL-HARNESS`,
`MERCURY-CROSS-PLATFORM-SERVICE`, `PUBLIC-SKILL-REGISTRY-CLIENT`, and
`VANTA-PUBLIC-SITE-V1`. The first executed story then exposed
`CHOICE-WALL-SIDE-EFFECT-GUARD`: post-turn learning wrote a skill after the agent said it
would wait for the operator's choice. The second executed story exposed and shipped
`GLOB-BASE-PATH-ROOT-SCOPE`: relative `glob_files` bases were resolved from the process
cwd instead of the declared project root, hiding root installer files. The first issue-pack
regression shipped `COMPACTION-INTENT-GROUNDING`: generated summaries are reference-only
and cannot preserve fabricated attributed user asks as actionable conversation turns.
`ACP-SESSION-ROUTING-ISOLATION` then bound peer updates and permission requests to session
IDs opened by the active ACP client, failing unknown-session approvals closed.
`SUBAGENT-PROVIDER-IDENTITY` prevents delegate/swarm provider switches from carrying an
incompatible parent model into the selected provider or user alias.
`MCP-RECONNECT-PROCESS-REAP` closes obsolete management clients before reconnect and
adds owned cleanup when the MCP panel is dismissed. `SAFE-MODE-STATE-ISOLATION` removes
persistent memory/settings from the real prompt path and proves plugins/MCP do not start.
`SESSION-ENV-OUTPUT-REDACTION` masks opaque credential slots and structured secrets before
session-environment listings can enter terminal recordings. `DESKTOP-GATEWAY-PROVIDER-PARITY`
adds user aliases to the desktop catalog and pins the same identity through gateway routing.
Together these shipped slices complete `HERMES-ISSUE-REGRESSION-PACK`. Continued story
execution shipped `LIVE-CONTEXT-COST-INSPECTOR` after three preserved failure receipts;
`HERMES-MULTITURN-STORY-RUNNER` captures the remaining same-session clarification and
approval proof gap instead of weakening choice-wall behavior. The Enterprise/Kubernetes
story then preserved two failed receipts before `WORKFLOW-ACCEPTANCE-EVIDENCE-CONTRACT`
required validated node-level evidence for schedule, isolation, secrets, health, rollback,
and approval. That run also exposed and shipped `SUCCESSFUL-TOOL-ERROR-CLASSIFICATION`, so
successful policy/rollback prose no longer opens a false repair loop. Five representative
Hermes scenarios now have explicit reviewed passes; the harness remains open for broader
category execution and deterministic outcome verifiers.

`HERMES-PROFILE-ROSTER` is now shipped. `vanta profiles` creates, clones, switches,
archives, targets, and inspects durable specialists. The selected profile redirects the
next Vanta process into its own home, isolating model/settings, skills, memory, gateway
identity/state, inbox, and work history. Operator Home renders the live roster, active and
queued counts, and latest targeted work. A real isolated CLI run exercised every action,
including restart activation and archival, before the card moved to shipped.
`HERMES-PROFILE-DISTRIBUTIONS` is shipped too. A `vanta-profile.json` distribution can
declare SOUL, settings, skills, cron, MCP, and profile defaults. `vanta profile install`
previews a local path or Git source before `--apply`; update reports owned-file diffs,
backs up the previous owned files, records the source commit, and preserves operator
settings, private memory, inbox, sessions, credentials, and history. Secret/history files
are refused even when they are not referenced by the manifest; secret-shaped JSON fields,
symlink source escapes, and tampered installed destination paths fail closed. Removed owned
files are deleted only after their previous copies are backed up.

`HERMES-KANBAN-ROUTER` is shipped. Existing durable Kanban lanes now carry optional
profile owner/fallback, required skills, dependencies, evidence receipts, wake policy,
retry count, and handoff history. `vanta kanban add|route|claim|handoff|update|retry`
drives those transitions; route inspects each persistent profile's installed skills,
dependencies and skill gaps fail closed, and done is refused without evidence. Operator
Home summarizes active and blocked lanes. A real CLI run installed a skilled profile,
routed, handed off, blocked, retried, closed with a receipt, rendered Home, and cleaned up
its proof board.

`HERMES-SECOND-BRAIN-CORPUS` is shipped. `vanta corpus ingest <folder|url>` compiles
Markdown, text, VTT, and SRT sources into `~/.vanta/corpus`; guarded URL fetches retain
source dates. `recall` fuses BM25, available embeddings, and entity links while printing
source/date/freshness receipts and naming only the retrieval signals actually used.
`status` and `refresh <id|all>` expose stale sources. Vault export is preview-first and
preserves raw-source and entity links. An isolated real CLI proof ingested a note plus a
downloaded-transcript fixture, recalled it, refreshed it, previewed five vault changes,
then applied and inspected all five files.

The extraction note is `docs/research/hermes-transcript-roadmap-extract-2026-07-11.md`;
the current Hermes repo comparison is `docs/research/hermes-current-vs-vanta-vision-2026-07-11.md`;
the 2026-07-12 current-main delta is `docs/research/hermes-current-delta-2026-07-12.md`;
the feature/function harvest is `docs/research/hermes-feature-function-harvest-2026-07-11.md`.
The issue, Mercury, and current user-story audit is
`docs/research/hermes-mercury-issue-usecase-audit-2026-07-11.md`. Build priority is public-site
v1 + story eval foundation → Hermes issue regression pack → profile roster + distributions
(shipped) → profile Kanban router (shipped) → second-brain corpus compiler (shipped). Promote credential
pools/vault-backed secrets after the profile/Kanban spine if multi-profile gateways or
run-anywhere execution need safer key distribution. The rest stay horizon until a concrete
workflow needs them.

`HERMES-STORY-EVAL-HARNESS` now has 30 versioned scenarios across all 15 Hermes story
categories, list/filter/run controls, live setup gates, redacted receipts, deterministic
contracts for the five reviewed passes, receipt history status, and a redacted public export.
The public use-case page links the generated 5-pass/5-category summary and names the ten
category gaps; fixtures never count as executed product proof.

`HERMES-MULTITURN-STORY-RUNNER` is shipped. Scripted manifests can declare the first
boundary and ordered operator replies; `vanta story-eval` sends them through one persistent
conversation without TTY parsing and records redacted per-turn outputs, tools, guards, and
boundary checks. The real converse-before-act story passed clarification, scope choice,
approval wall, and rejection in four turns with no file or shell action.

`HERMES-TOOL-SURFACE-PROFILES` is shipped. Profiles and distributions can declare
`allowedTools`; the live registry enforces the allowlist for built-ins and late MCP/plugin
registration. `vanta profiles tools` edits the boundary, while `vanta tools why` explains
role visibility, typical per-call kernel risk, setup, missing credentials, and repair.
Profiles without an allowlist warn that they expose the full surface, and failed calls append
the same repair path after retries.

`HERMES-DELEGATION-TREE-RECEIPTS` is shipped. Workers still return only compact summaries
to the parent and preserve full sidechains; delegation now records parent/child linkage,
prompt, model, tools, summary, verification, raw path, elapsed time, usage, and estimated
cost. `vanta agents delegations` and Operator Home inspect trees; replay/follow-up controls
queue tracked work rather than executing silently.

## TUI — real terminal UI (shipped 2026-06-02)
- **Streaming engine**: `LLMProvider.stream()` (OpenAI family **+ Anthropic**) yields `StreamChunk`s — token deltas, **`thinking` (live reasoning, universal)**, and tool calls; `agent.ts` emits them via `onTextDelta`/`onThinkingDelta` (falls back to `complete()` when unused). Pure `foldToolCallDeltas`/`reasoningDelta`/`streamAnthropicEvents` assemble the streamed shapes.
- **Ink TUI** (`tui/app.tsx` + `tui/launch.tsx`): React/Ink 7 app — streaming transcript (live token-by-token), interleaved tool activity (`→`/`✓`/`✗`), spinner status line (model + state), input composer (`ink-text-input`), **inline approval prompts** for kernel `ask` risks, minimal slash (`/help /clear /model /exit`). `vanta` launches it on a TTY; `--no-tui` / `VANTA_NO_TUI` / resume / non-TTY fall back to the readline REPL (which keeps the full slash set).
- Verified: pure reducer + `ink-testing-library` render smoke + module load under tsx. **Live streaming in a real terminal is the user's to confirm** (a TTY is needed; can't drive one from the build sandbox). New deps: `ink`, `react`, `ink-text-input` (+ dev `@types/react`, `ink-testing-library`).
- *Next for the TUI:* full slash parity in-TUI (refactor repl-commands to return lines), scrollback/virtual history, resume-in-TUI, wire the self-improvement review without console noise.

## Install & REPL (shipped 2026-06-02)
- **`./install.sh`** — builds kernel + deps, seeds `~/.vanta/skills`, installs a global **`vanta`** launcher into `~/.local/bin` (only edits a shell rc if that dir isn't already on PATH). Type `vanta` from anywhere.
- **Full REPL slash commands** (`repl-commands.ts`): `/help /exit /clear /skills /tools /model /status /goals /sessions /resume <id> /cron` — was only `/help /exit /skills`.

## v1 done — one sentence

Open `vanta` → it greets you and talks back → a first-run wizard configures any model
backend (ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini / local / OpenRouter) without editing files → it
remembers conversations across sessions → it learns from what it does (writes its own
skills, prunes them safely) → it's reachable as a background service you can text.

## Build order (execute top-down; each slice = real code + co-located tests + `tsc` clean + one commit)

### A — Hook to any model + full setup  ← ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-02 (live-verified on Gemini)
- [x] **A1 · Gemini provider** (S) — Google's OpenAI-compatible endpoint via the OpenAI adapter (baseURL swap), `GEMINI_API_KEY`/`GOOGLE_API_KEY`. **Live-verified:** `VANTA_PROVIDER=gemini vanta run` returns on `gemini-2.5-flash`.
- [~] **A2 · Provider registry** — **DEFERRED** (review call): two adapters cover 5 providers; the full ProviderProfile registry is premature (over-generalization). A small shared `providers/catalog.ts` was extracted instead. Build the registry at the 6th provider / 3rd wire format.
- [x] **A3 · OpenRouter provider** (S) — one key → 200+ models, OpenAI-compatible. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
- [x] **A4 · `vanta setup` wizard** (M) — provider picker → hidden key prompt → **merge** into `vanta-ts/.env` (pure `upsertEnv`, preserves all other keys) → model w/ default → persist (0600). Unit + integration tested.
- [x] **A5 · First-run detection** (S) — no resolvable backend on launch → auto-run `vanta setup`, **TTY-gated** (non-interactive callers told to run `vanta setup`, never block). Wired `setup`/`status`/`doctor` commands.
- [x] **A6 · `vanta status` / `vanta doctor`** (S) — boxed health: kernel **ping only** (never spawn), provider+model, per-provider key **presence** (✓/✗, never the value), store + skill/memory/goal counts. Live-verified.

### B — Self-improvement loop  ← ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-02 (live-verified on Gemini)
- [~] **B1 · Hook spine** — **DEFERRED** (same call as A2): the review is wired directly at the post-turn site in both callers; one consumer doesn't justify a generic 5-event bus. Build it at the 2nd consumer (Rule of 3).
- [x] **B2 · Post-turn nudge counters** (S) — pure `shouldReview(toolIterations, turnIndex, env)`: fires on a busy turn (≥`VANTA_REVIEW_MIN_TOOLS`, default 6) or periodically (every `VANTA_REVIEW_EVERY`, default 8). `toolIterations` added to `AgentOutcome`. `VANTA_SELF_IMPROVE=0` disables.
- [x] **B3 · Background-review fork** (M) — `review/background-review.ts`: post-turn, spawns a tool-restricted agent (`recall` + `write_skill` only), replays the transcript, review prompt biased to act with the do-NOT-capture list. Best-effort — never fails the main turn. Live-verified (judged "no skill" on a trivial turn; unit-tested write path).
- [x] **B4 · Skill provenance + safe curator** (M) — review-written skills tagged `vanta-learned` (`LEARNED_TAG`); curator **never auto-deletes** (archives only `vanta-learned` stale skills — reversible; reports stale hand-authored + long-archived instead of touching them); `maybeCurate()` wired at session start, 7d-interval-gated via `~/.vanta/.curator_state.json`.
- [~] **B5 · Memory pre/post-turn** — **PARTIAL**: post-turn memory already written (`writeRunMemory`); pre-turn recall already injected (`recentMemory`→prompt). Remaining: move recall from the system prompt's volatile tier into the user message to preserve prefix-cache (optimization, deferred).

### C — Continuity  ← ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-02 (live-verified resume on Gemini)
- [x] **C1 · Session persist + resume** (M) — **file-based** (`~/.vanta/sessions/<id>.json`, id `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`), not SQLite — dependency-free + git-versionable, consistent with skills/memory (avoids Node's flagged experimental `node:sqlite`). `sessions/store.ts` (zod-validated round-trip), `createConversation(...,{history})` seeds prior turns + fresh system prompt, `vanta sessions` lists newest-first, `vanta resume <id>` / `vanta --resume <id>` rehydrates. Saved after every turn. Bonus: fixed REPL Ctrl+D/EOF to exit cleanly instead of erroring.

### D — Borrow the skills library  ← ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-02
- [x] **D1 · Port skills** (M) — 10 high-value skills ported into bundled `vanta-ts/skills-library/` (coupling stripped: env vars renamed to `VANTA_*`, `delegate_task`→delegate subagent, external-agent-specific TUI/kanban removed), with `vanta skills install [--force]` → idempotent, non-destructive copy into `~/.vanta/skills/` (`skills/library.ts`). Ported: systematic-debugging, test-driven-development, writing-plans, requesting-code-review, spike, humanizer, github-pr-workflow, claude-design, duckduckgo-search, build-retro. Live-verified install (10/10).
- [x] **D2 · Skill bundles** (S) — YAML bundle schema for loading a named skill set and instruction through one command.

### E — Autonomy & reach  ← shipped; the daemon remains the keystone
- [x] **E1 · Daemon / service mode** (M/L) — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-02. `vanta gateway` foreground daemon (`gateway/run.ts`: interruptible tick loop over `runDueTasks`, SIGINT/SIGTERM-clean, one bad task non-fatal). launchd service manager (`service/`: pure plist gen + `vanta service install|uninstall|status`, captures PATH so launchd finds node/cargo). Cron no longer needs an external trigger. Verified: foreground daemon starts/ticks/stops; `service status` read-only. (`launchctl load` not auto-run — installing a persistent agent needs the user's OK.)
- [x] **E2 · Telegram gateway** (M) — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-02 (offline-tested; live needs a bot token). `PlatformAdapter` contract (`gateway/platforms/base.ts`) + `TelegramAdapter` (getUpdates long-poll + sendMessage, pure `parseUpdates`/`parseAllowlist`, chat-id allowlist). Wired into the gateway: each tick polls, runs inbound → agent turn → reply (`pollPlatform`, handler error becomes the reply). Auto-enabled by `VANTA_TELEGRAM_TOKEN`. **Live use needs a @BotFather token** (I can't provision one). *Limitation:* each message is a one-shot run (no per-chat session yet — future, key sessions by chatId). Other ~19 platforms deferred (Rule of 3).
- [x] **E3 · Webhook triggers + deliver targets** (M) — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-02 (HMAC + HTTP integration-tested). `gateway/webhook.ts`: constant-time `verifyGithubSignature` (sha256 HMAC, known-vector tested), `resolveDeliver` (`local`/`file:<path>`/`telegram:<chatId>`), `startWebhookServer` (POST-only, HMAC-gated, 200-fast + background agent run). Wired into the daemon (`VANTA_WEBHOOK_PORT`/`_SECRET`/`_PROMPT`/`_DELIVER`); inbound event → agent turn → deliver. Verified via real localhost requests (200 signed / 401 unsigned / 405 non-POST).
- [~] **E4 · Interrupt** (S) — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-02 (unit-tested). `AbortSignal` in `AgentDeps`, checked between loop iterations → `stoppedReason: "interrupted"` (post-run memory still runs). Ctrl+C aborts a one-shot `vanta run` gracefully instead of hard-killing. **Steer (mid-turn message injection) deferred** — needs non-blocking stdin during a turn (a REPL redesign); low value in the current synchronous loop.
- [x] **E5 · MCP client** (M) — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-02 (protocol unit-tested; live needs a real MCP server). Dependency-free stdio JSON-RPC client (`mcp/client.ts`, injectable transport — initialize/tools-list/tools-call, concurrent-request correlation, error→reject) + `mcp/mount.ts` (config from `VANTA_MCP_SERVERS` or `~/.vanta/mcp.json`, spawns each server best-effort, registers discovered tools as Vanta tools through the **same kernel `assess()`**). Mounted in `prepareRun` (no-op without config). StreamableHTTP transport + per-chat reuse = future; direct Google integrations kept as-is.
- [ ] **E6 · ACP server wrapper** (L, optional) — implement ACP `Agent` methods over Vanta's session + delegate primitives so editors (Zed-style) can drive Vanta. *Why:* networked cross-agent without inventing a protocol. Lowest priority.

### F — Robustness steals (cheap, fold in opportunistically)
- [x] **F1 · Message sanitization** (S) — `sanitizeMessages` (context.ts), run pre-flight before every model call: drops orphaned tool_results + strips lone Unicode surrogates (keeps valid emoji pairs). *Prevents silent 400s.*
- [x] **F2 · Loop guardrails** — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-02. Stops on 3 consecutive empty results (`MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES`) AND on the same tool+args called 3× in a turn (`MAX_IDENTICAL_CALLS` — stuck-in-a-rut detection). Unit-tested.
- [ ] **F3 · Subdirectory hints** (S) — inject cwd hint after file/shell tool results.
- [~] **F4 · Retry w/ jittered backoff** — the `openai` SDK already retries with backoff (maxRetries default 2); explicit per-model tracking deferred unless we hit limits.

### G — Subscription auth  ← G1 + G2(Codex) SHIPPED (grey area, user-run)
- [x] **G1 · Claude subscription (`claude-code` provider)** — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-02 (unit-tested; **user live-verifies** — the harness blocks the assistant from running it as credential-repurposing). `VANTA_PROVIDER=claude-code` uses your Claude Pro/Max OAuth token (from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`). The earlier "not viable" was WRONG — it works with the full Claude-Code header set + system-prompt spoof (see DECISIONS reversal). **Grey area** under Anthropic ToS; the wizard labels it as such. API keys remain the clean path.
- [x] **G2 · ChatGPT-Codex OAuth** — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-02 (unit-tested + **live-verified** end-to-end with real `~/.codex/auth.json`; user-run, same grey-area as G1). `VANTA_PROVIDER=codex` uses your ChatGPT subscription via the Codex CLI's OAuth session — Responses API at `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex`, refresh + write-back to the shared `~/.codex/auth.json`. The earlier "deferred, same gating as Claude" was WRONG: the Codex backend accepts subscription tokens (see DECISIONS reversal). `providers/codex.ts` + `codex-auth.ts`. **Gemini-CLI OAuth still deferred** — API keys cover Gemini; revisit only if asked.

---

## Sequencing logic

1. **A first** — it's the literal end-state ("open → setup → hook to ChatGPT/Gemini → run") and unblocks daily use.
2. **B + C next** — self-improvement and memory-of-conversations are what make it *feel* like an agent rather than a CLI; B is the "self-improves everything" ask.
3. **D** any time — pure content, no code risk; high capability-per-effort.
4. **E last** — daemon (E1) is the keystone; gateways/webhooks/steer hang off it. Bigger, lower daily value until A–D land.
5. **F** folded in opportunistically; **G** enhances A when API-key parity is proven.

## What stays out of v1 (→ PARKED)
Bedrock + the long tail of ~20 niche providers; the other ~19 messaging platforms beyond Telegram; image-gen / transcription providers; multi-credential failover pool; trajectory/datagen pipeline (training-data, not runtime); desktop (Tauri) app.

---

## v1.1 — Feature parity (2026-06-02) — CORE COMPLETE
Founding mandate: broad capability + kernel-enforced safety as the differentiator. **Full audit + gap matrix: [`docs/feature-audit.md`](docs/feature-audit.md) — all 8 manifesto hard lines verified in code; core parity met.** P1/P1b/P2/P3/P4/P5 shipped 2026-06-02; remaining deltas (session search, more platforms, desktop/web UI, skill breadth) parked by design.

- [x] **P1 + P1b · Slash-command parity** — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-02. `/history /retry /undo /reset` (commits `73bf5c6`) + `/title /fork` (`2285270`), both readline + TUI. `/redraw` dropped (TUI auto-renders). Known minor gap: TUI `/undo` retracts model history but not the rendered transcript (needs a reducer action) — readline is fully correct.
- [x] **P2 · Memory parity** — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-02. Injection was already capped; added a **stored-file cap** (`VANTA_MEMORY_MAX_BLOCKS`, default 50) — older blocks pruned from the live file but git-retained. (Memory compression deferred — optional.)
- [x] **P3 · Self-improvement parity** — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-02. Curator + `write_skill` + background-review (track B) were present; closed the real gap = **skill-index injection** (`buildSystemPrompt` injects names+descriptions; `recall` now loads the full body on demand). Index-in-prompt / body-on-demand / curator pattern complete.
- [x] **P4 · Identity reframe** — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-02. `prompt.ts`: default soul + rules reframed from repo-confined coding tool → "trusted personal operator" operating across the user's digital life (code/research/comms/calendar/web/business) while keeping goal-gating + verified-output + honest-about-limits. Rule 5 changed from "Never write outside root" → "file writes stay within root; the kernel gates everything else." Safety stays code-enforced (`resolveInScope` + kernel `assess`), independent of wording. 457 green, tsc clean.
- [x] **P5 · Capability breadth (banner)** — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-02. Both banners (TUI + readline) now group tools by **domain** (`tui/capabilities.ts`), reading like a personal operator. Adding more tools is demand-driven.
- [~] **P6 · Skills — PARKED.** Curate a small high-value set later, demand-driven. Lowest priority.

## v1.3 — Autonomy + senses (requested 2026-06-02, rapid-fire)
- [x] **O1 · Agent-chosen model on delegate** — ✅ SHIPPED. `delegate` provider/model params + tool description. Agent routes subtasks to any backend (Ollama, Gemini, etc.).
- [x] **O2 · Swarms** — ✅ SHIPPED. `tools/swarm.ts` — parallel multi-agent workers, fan-out + synthesize.
- [x] **O3 · Eyes (screen)** — ✅ SHIPPED. `look_at_screen` — `screencapture -x` → vision model. Needs Screen Recording permission.
- [x] **O4 · Camera** — ✅ SHIPPED. `look_at_camera` — webcam frame → vision model.
- [x] **O5 · Video** — ✅ SHIPPED. `watch_video` — ffmpeg frame extraction → vision model.
- [x] **O6 · Self-directed model selection** — ✅ shipped with O1.
- [x] **O7 · Speech & audio** — ✅ SHIPPED. `speak` (TTS via `say`) + `transcribe` (STT via whisper).
- [x] **O8 · Self-improving via the web** — ✅ SHIPPED (behavior). Prompt rule 9 + brain Growth drive directs the agent to browse and write skills from what it learns.
- [x] **O9 · Self-improving codebase ("dark factory")** — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-03. `factory/` module: triage → plan → execute → verify → commit. Kernel-enforced: `is_protected_path` blocks writes to `src/*.rs`, `factory/*.ts`, `MANIFESTO.md`. `vanta improve` (review mode) + `vanta factory approve` (auto). Live-verified end-to-end.

## v1.5 — Efficiency & emergent brain (requested 2026-06-03)
Target hardware: MacBook Pro 14" M4 Pro / 48GB / macOS Tahoe — must run lean here.
- [~] **E-eff1 · Token + power frugality** — agent uses as few tokens / as little power as it can, "however it sees fit": concise by default, prefer LOCAL (Ollama) models for simple subtasks via delegate, trim prompt injection when context is tight. Bake a frugality directive into the prompt + brain drives. (directive shipped; routing heuristics next)
- [x] **E-eff2 · Prefer-local routing** — auto-route simple/cheap work to local Ollama on the M4 Pro; reserve paid frontier models for hard reasoning.
- [x] **B-v2 · Emergent self-designed brain** — self-designed brain substrate operating under the kernel boundary.
- [ ] **META · Don't stop until complete** — standing directive: work the whole backlog top-down, commit + push every slice, until done. (Active.)

## v1.6 — MCP: use · make · serve (requested 2026-06-03)
Vanta as a self-extending operator: consume any MCP server, build/hook in new ones on
its own, and be callable as a server itself. Extends **E5** (MCP client, shipped). Built
in order — each phase ships working before the next starts (anti-drift: no three-half-things).
- [x] **MCP-1 · Use any MCP (consume)** (S) — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-04. `readMcpConfig` now accepts Claude's `mcpServers` key (alongside `servers`) and discovers `./.mcp.json` in the project (project wins over `~/.vanta/mcp.json`; `VANTA_MCP_SERVERS` still wins inline). `vanta mcp list` lists configured servers. Config discovery done + unit-tested (+4 tests); live consume needs a real server.
- [x] **MCP-2 · Make + hook in at runtime** (M) — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-04. **`mount_mcp` tool** (`tools/mount-mcp.ts`): `buildMountMcpTool(registry)` factory spawns an MCP server, mounts its tools into the LIVE registry mid-session, kernel-gated via `assess()` (`describeForSafety` → "spawn mcp server …"). **`build-mcp-server` skill** (`skills-library/`): teaches Vanta to scaffold a TS MCP server with the SDK, build it, and mount it. **Done =** mount_mcp registers a server's tools into the running registry; skill covers scaffold-on-demand.
- [x] **MCP-3 · Be a server (serve)** (M/L) — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-04. **`vanta mcp serve`** (`mcp/server.ts`): exposes Vanta's tools over MCP stdio (JSON-RPC 2.0, mirror of `client.ts`). Every `tools/call` routes through the kernel `assess()` gate — `block`/`ask` refused as `isError` results (headless: no human to prompt), only `allow` executes. Read-only **allowlist** (`VANTA_MCP_SERVE_TOOLS`, defaults to 9 read-only tools) bounds exposure; the kernel is the real boundary. `console.log→stderr` keeps the protocol stream clean. **Done (live-verified):** a real `McpClient` drove the `vanta mcp serve` subprocess end-to-end — handshake, `tools/list` (filtered), `read_file` allow→executed, out-of-scope refused, non-allowlisted refused. *another agent integration itself untested (offline-verified via reciprocal client, house discipline like E2/E5).* Supersedes **E6** (ACP wrapper).

## v1.4 — Selfhood & continuous learning (requested 2026-06-02/03)
The agent grows an identity and a living model of its world. Everything here stays
under the kernel's hard lines (non-destructive, verified, approval-before-risk).
- [x] **S1 · Self-authored identity files** — ✅ SHIPPED. Brain regions (`~/.vanta/brain/`: identity, semantic, episodic, user_model, drives, reflections, mood). `brain` tool + `/memory`. `SOUL.md` + `AGENT-MANIFESTO.md` at repo root.
- [~] **S2 · Personality develops from interaction** — PARTIAL. Brain `user_model` region + prompt rule 9 drives it. Full personality.md evolution loop is demand-driven.
- [~] **S3 · Continuous world/user/codebase context** — PARTIAL. Brain regions + post-turn memory cover this. Full heartbeat-driven refresh ties to S5.
- [~] **S4 · Skill authorship discipline** — PARTIAL. Curator uses `LEARNED_TAG` + never-auto-deletes. Versioning/merge on `write_skill` deferred.
- [x] **S5 · Heartbeat** — steady tick driving selfhood updates and the factory loop.

## v2 — Living operator & JARVIS arc (requested 2026-06-05)
> Status source: `roadmap.json` (29 new items). Synthesis + build order + the not-evil charter:
> [`docs/living-operator.md`](docs/living-operator.md). Direction locked in `DECISIONS.md` (2026-06-05).

From three captures (`vanta wants.rtf`, `argowants2.rtf`, `agro wants 3.md`) + two live goals (natural
voice; sentience-like continuity). **Sentience as a direction, not a claim.** Most of `argowants2`'s
"brain architecture" is already shipped (BRAIN-*, EF-*, MEM-*, senses O3–O7) — the new work is
connective tissue + a few organs, not a new brain.

- **Arc A — Living operator (spine, near-term).** Continuity/honesty/learning that makes Vanta
  trustworthy + alive-like. Rocks: `MEM-CURATOR` (the named first slice — compress sessions →
  durable notes), `MEM-FORGET`, `TRUST-LABELS`, `SCAFFOLD`, `VOICE-NATURAL`, `CHARTER`, **`REFLECT-CORRECT`** (promoted from pebble — see below). Pebbles/sand:
  `TASTE-ENGINE`, `ANTI-SLOP`, `SELF-EVAL`, `PROJECT-RADAR`, `ENERGY-PLAN`,
  `COMMS-TRIAGE`, `PROTOCOLS`, `RESEARCH-LOOP`, `BETTER-ENDINGS`, `ACTION-PROOF`, `COST-VISIBLE`,
  `DECISION-GUARD`. Horizon: `WORLD-MODEL`, `LIFE-SEARCH`, `AMBIENT`.

### REFLECT-CORRECT — conversation-to-memory correction loop (Arc A rock)

**The problem this solves:** LLMs can adapt within a conversation — adjust tone, correct a mistake, follow feedback, improve an answer in real time. What they can't do is rewrite their own weights or persist that learning across sessions. Each conversation starts fresh. The same mistake recurs. The same correction has to be given again.

Vanta is in a unique position to close this gap: it has a persistent brain (`~/.vanta/brain/`), a post-turn write hook (`writeRunMemory`), and a background review process (B3) that already fires after turns. It can do what the underlying model can't — detect when a correction happened in-session and write it to durable memory so next session starts with that lesson already loaded.

**Done =** when a user corrects Vanta's output mid-session (explicit "don't do X", negation of a prior action, or rephrasing of a failed output), that correction is automatically written to `brain/reflections.md` and/or `brain/user_model.md` and injected into the next session's system prompt. Same mistake should not recur across sessions.

**Implementation path (S — ~1–2 days):**
- Add `correction-detector.ts` to `review/`: scans the user's last N messages for correction signals (negation patterns, explicit instruction to change approach, "that's wrong because X")
- On detection, write a structured entry: `[date] — correction: [what was wrong] → [what to do instead]`
- Target region: `brain/reflections.md` for behavioral corrections, `brain/user_model.md` for preference corrections
- Hook into B3's post-turn flow (`review/background-review.ts`) alongside existing skill-writing logic
- Pre-turn injection already works — brain is injected into the system prompt; no new plumbing needed
- `VANTA_CORRECTION_DETECT=0` disables (same pattern as `VANTA_SELF_IMPROVE=0`)

**Why this matters beyond Vanta:** This is the practical answer to a real AI limitation — not "train the model" (requires Anthropic), not "hope the model adapts" (session-scoped only), but "build the feedback loop at the operator layer." The operator catches what the model forgets.
- **Arc B — JARVIS / command center (breadth, build small, later).** Omni-capable, non-evil,
  human-aligned life/world partner; business is *one facet*, not the identity. `LIFE-OS-SCHEMA`,
  `AGENT-COUNCIL` (15 bounded roles), `PROTECTION-AGENT`, `BRIEF-CMD` (`vanta today`/`brief`),
  `MONEY-OS` (`vanta money` + escape-the-9-to-5), `REVIEW-LOOPS`; horizon `COMMAND-CENTER`.
  Jason's own rule: *do not build full JARVIS at once.*

## SHIPPED in the 2026-06-02/03 build marathon (all committed + pushed)
**501 TS + 21 Rust tests green, tsc clean.** Across v1.1–v1.5:
- **Providers:** Codex ChatGPT-OAuth, claude-code; agent-chosen model on `delegate` (O1/O6) + workers get skill index + brain.
- **Senses:** native image input (paste/drag-drop/`/image`/`/paste`/`/attachments`); `look_at_screen` (eyes, O3); `watch_video` (O5); `speak` TTS (O7); vision routed through the ACTIVE provider.
- **Selfhood:** Vanta **brain** (`~/.vanta/brain/`, 7 regions, neurodivergent-first identity, frugality drive) read each session + `brain` tool + `/memory`.
- **UX:** queued type-ahead (U1), notifications (U3), real token usage (U4), `/compress` (U5), `/memory` (U6), `/export` (U7); full command set incl. `/goal /plan /title /fork /history /retry /undo /usage /copy /update`.
- **Skills/memory:** skill-index injection + recall-body, capped memory, `skills lint`, in-session `todo`+`/plan`.
- **Safety (manifesto-critical):** kernel `assess_action` hardened against known denylist/scope bypasses (broadened set, interpreter vectors, absolute-path-outside-root).
- **Efficiency:** token/power frugality directive; prefer-local delegation. **Installer:** `bootstrap.sh`. **Docs:** MANIFESTO + feature-audit + agent-cli-gaps; CLAUDE.md kept current.

## ALSO SHIPPED in the marathon (continued)
O2 swarms · O4 camera (`look_at_camera`) · O5 video (`watch_video`) · O7 speak (TTS) + transcribe (STT) ·
volatile skills (#36656) · `/context` · `/mcp` · `/export` · `/compress` · `/memory` · `/plan`+todo ·
`skills lint` · O8/S2/S3 continuous-self-improvement behavior (prompt rule 9 + brain Growth drive).

## SHIPPED 2026-06-04 (build sprint — session 2)
**751 tests green (27 Rust + 724 TS) · tsc clean · pushed · all files ≤300 lines.**
- **KANBAN-S2 · Drag-and-drop roadmap board:** `roadmap/server.ts` — `GET /roadmap/board` serves `roadmap.html`; `POST /roadmap/move` → `moveRoadmapItem` live. `vanta roadmap serve` builds + opens `http://localhost:7789/roadmap/board`. Drag a card between columns → board reloads.
- **TUI-INPUT · Composer history + multiline:** up/down arrows cycle sent messages (`navigateHistory` pure helper, tested). Shift+enter inserts `\n` at cursor (modern terminals). History active only when slash/@ palette not showing.
- **TUI-MARKDOWN · Markdown rendering in transcript:** `tui/markdown.tsx` — `tokenizeInline` (**bold**, `code`) + `parseBlocks` (h1-3, bullets, numbered, fenced code, spacer) + `renderMarkdown` Ink renderer. Committed assistant entries route through it.
- **ND1 · /next:** reads active kernel goals → sends agent a one-shot "concrete next micro-step" prompt. `repl/next.ts` + wired in HANDLERS + SLASH_COMMANDS.
- **ND3 · /planmode:** toggle plan-first mode via `PLAN_MARKER` injection into live system prompt. `/planmode [on|off]`. `repl/plan-mode.ts`.
- **U2 · @-file context:** `tui/at-context.ts` — `parseAtRefs`, `activeAtRef`, `buildContextBlock`, `listRepoFiles`. TUI shows @ autocomplete palette (↑↓ tab); on submit, `@path` refs are resolved to `<file>` context blocks prepended to the agent message.
- **Compliance cleanup:** extracted `app-reducer.ts` + `useAgentSend` hook; `app.tsx` 398→178 lines; `parseBlocks` 58→22 lines; all new files ≤300, all non-component fns ≤50.

## SHIPPED 2026-06-03 (post-marathon session)
**581 tests green (27 Rust + 554 TS) · tsc clean · pushed.**
- **Bug fixes (4):** dropped file paths treated as slash commands (readline + TUI) · video drops not routed to `watch_video` · `look_at_screen` cryptic permission error → friendly hint · agent falsely claimed Desktop image paths were out of scope.
- **O9 dark factory (complete):** `factory/` module (triage/planner/executor/verifier/run) · kernel `is_protected_path` (27 Rust tests) · `vanta improve` + `vanta factory [approve|status]` CLI · gateway detached-child spawn for `__factory__` cron entries · `AGENT-MANIFESTO.md` · live end-to-end verified (verifier correctly rejected a bad model output, discarded cleanly).

## RESIDUAL — open-ended or demand-driven (not blocking daily use)
- **Polish tier:** themes · `/vim` · multi-dir `/add-dir` · S4 skill-versioning-on-write · cron-output-awareness (gateway). *(U2 @-mentions shipped 2026-06-04)*
- [x] **SCOPE-2 · Readable zones (read across the workspace)** (S) — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-04. The read-side mirror of SCOPE-1. `read_file` hard-refused out-of-repo reads, so Vanta couldn't read a sibling repo's skills (`~/Documents/GitHub/theft-kit/...`) even though `shell_cmd cat` could. Now `read_file` reads from **readable zones** — default = the project's **parent dir** (so sibling repos in the same workspace are readable) + the writable zones; `VANTA_READABLE_DIRS` override. Generalized `isInWritableZone`→`isInZone` + `resolveReadableZones(env,root)` in `tools/writable-zones.ts`; `~`-expansion. **Verified:** unit (12 zone + 2 read_file) + live (read `theft-kit/design-html/SKILL.md`, 64 KB; `~/.ssh/id_rsa` still refused). **Follow-up:** secret-filename read-guard (`.env`/`*.key`/`id_rsa`) even in-zone — readable zones currently expose sibling secrets to kernel-Asked reads.
- [x] **SCOPE-1 · Writable zones beyond the repo** (S) — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-04. `write_file` no longer hard-refuses out-of-repo paths; it writes into **bounded, approval-gated writable zones** (`tools/writable-zones.ts`: default `~/Desktop` + `~/Downloads`, `VANTA_WRITABLE_DIRS` override). **TS-only** — the kernel already returned `Ask` for out-of-root paths (`mentions_outside_home`/`references_abs_path_outside_root`, safety.rs:71), so dispatch already prompts the human; the tool was simply stricter than the boundary and refused *after* approval. Now: in-repo writes free, in-zone writes proceed (kernel Asked at dispatch), **out-of-zone still refused** (the backstop against yes-fatigue on `~/.ssh`). `~`-expansion + prefix-collision-safe (`Desktop-evil` ≠ `Desktop`). Chose **bounded zones** over any-path-with-approval. **Verified:** unit (9 zone + 2 write_file) + live (wrote directly to `~/Desktop` in one step).
- [x] **O10 · Autonomy ladder (L1–L4, kernel-bounded)** (M) — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-04. Replaced the factory's binary review-vs-auto with a selectable level in `factory/run.ts`: **L1** suggest (plan, no branch) · **L2** implement (branch→execute→verify, stop for diff review) · **L3** commit (no push) · **L4** push. `resolveAutonomyLevel(sub, env)` maps `improve`→L1 and `approve`→`VANTA_AUTONOMY_LEVEL` (default 4, preserving prior commit+push). Split `commitAndPush`→`commitSlice`+`pushBranch`; added `implemented` + `committed{pushed}` CycleResult statuses. The kernel's `is_protected_path` still blocks skeleton/brainstem (kernel/factory/manifesto) at **every** level — the ladder governs reach over writable code only. **Verified:** 15 `run.test.ts` (incl. `resolveAutonomyLevel` clamp/default/garbage), tsc clean. **L6** (edit safety-critical code) remains **not grantable by config** — out-of-band human approval only.
- [x] **O10b · Autonomy L5 (auto-merge low-risk)** (M) — low-risk auto-merge rung with classifier gates and bounded default-branch behavior.
- [x] **O11 · Compartmentalized self-repair (the body model)** (M) — explicit compartment tiers cap self-modification autonomy and preserve rollback boundaries.
- [x] **INSTALL · One-line curl install** (S) — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-04. `bootstrap.sh` (repo root) clones Vanta into `~/vanta` (`VANTA_DIR` override; default branch — no pin, so it self-adjusts when `main` is cut) then `exec`s the existing `install.sh`. Idempotent (re-run fast-forwards). `install.sh` has **no interactive prompts**, so a piped install can't crash (setup stays a separate `vanta setup` step). README documents the one-liner. **Verified:** clone + `install.sh` handoff via a local clone smoke. *The `curl … raw.githubusercontent.com | bash` one-liner activates when the repo flips public; while private, clone via git auth.*
- [x] **SEC · Secret-hygiene hardening** (S) — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-04. **`gitleaks` pre-commit hook** (`scripts/pre-commit` → symlinked into `.git/hooks/` by `install.sh`) runs `gitleaks protect --staged --config .gitleaks.toml` and blocks any secret-shaped string. `.gitleaks.toml` extends the default ruleset + allowlists `.example` twins and test fixtures. `.mcp.json.example` committed; real `.env`/`.mcp.json` stay gitignored. **Rule: a token in a gitignored file is safe; a token in a commit is burned.** *(False-alarm 2026-06-03 that prompted this: the cosmos `.mcp.json` token was gitignored and never committed — history scan clean, no rotation. The hook removes the guesswork.)*

## v1.2 — the CLI UX parity (non-coding) — gap analysis 2026-06-02
Full grounded gap list: [`docs/agent-cli-gaps.md`](docs/agent-cli-gaps.md) (vs another agent 2.1.156, coding-specific features excluded, Vanta side verified against the repo). Build order:
- [x] **U1 · Queued input while busy** — ✅ SHIPPED. Type-ahead queue in TUI reducer + readline; drained on turn end.
- [x] **U2 · @-file mentions** (★★★) — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-04. TUI @ autocomplete palette (↑↓ tab) + context injection on submit (`tui/at-context.ts`). See session 2 entry above.
- [x] **U3 · Notifications** — ✅ SHIPPED. Terminal bell + `osascript` desktop ping on turn-complete and approval-needed.
- [x] **U4 · Real token/cost usage** — ✅ SHIPPED. Provider `usage` fields captured → exact tokens in `/usage` + status bar.
- [x] **U5 · /context + /compress** — ✅ SHIPPED. `/context` shows token-budget breakdown; `/compress` triggers manual compaction.
- [x] **U6 · /memory quick-add** — ✅ SHIPPED. `/memory <text>` appends to brain semantic region mid-turn.
- [x] **U7+ · export · /mcp · /copy · /update** — ✅ SHIPPED. `/export` (markdown transcript), `/mcp` (list servers), `/copy` (clipboard), `/update` (git pull). Multi-dir `/add-dir` + themes + `/vim` remain demand-driven.
Shipped already vs Claude CLI: image paste/drag-drop, slash palette, /model picker, /copy, /usage, streaming, approvals.

**Self-evolving agent research takeaways (Nemotron Labs, 2026):** The skill-bloat answer is NOT fewer/curated skills — it's **management**: inject only the skill *index* (names+descriptions) into context, adaptive-search to pull a full skill *body* on demand, and a background **curator** that prunes/compresses/revises the library. Vanta already has the curator (track B); the missing piece is **index-only injection + on-demand body load** (currently Vanta lists skills but should verify it's not over-injecting). Memory layer is **capped and pruned** (relevance decays over time). Identity carries a persona + "rules of engagement" + a sense of shared history with the user (loyalty) as prompt-injection resistance, paired with hard kernel boundaries. → This **reframes P6**: the win is the skill *system* (index/search/curator), so a small high-value seed set + good management beats bulk-porting.

## 2026-06-05 — Auxiliary-task delegation + operator self-improvement (captured)
Two goal-dumps this session. UI bugs (width fill · slash palette 8-item cap · skill-index trim) shipped inline. Rest captured here; build order set by leverage × effort.

**Auxiliary-task gap:** Bind each *function* (vision, summarization, title-gen, embeddings) to its own model, independent of the main agent model. Without this, a non-vision main model (DeepSeek V4 Flash, local text-only Ollama) silently breaks vision. AUX-VISION (shipped) re-introduces `VANTA_VISION_MODEL`; AUX-MAP generalizes it.
- [x] **AUX-VISION** (S) — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-05. `routing/vision.ts` (`visionEnv` pure + `resolveVisionProvider`); all 3 image tools (`describe_image`, `look_at_screen`, `look_at_camera`) route to `VANTA_VISION_MODEL` (+ optional `VANTA_VISION_PROVIDER`) when set, else the active provider (prior behavior). Fixes vision silently breaking on a text-only main model. 4 unit tests, full suite green (1067 TS), `.env.example` + both `CLAUDE.md` updated. *The explicit "delegate those vision tasks today" ask.*
- [x] **UI-READABILITY** (S) — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-05. TUI fills terminal width (removed 100-col cap, `tui/app.tsx`) · slash palette capped to 8 + fixed command column + width-clipped descriptions (`tui/transcript.tsx`, was unbounded ragged `space-between` → typing `/` dumped all 37) · `/skills` aligns names + clips to one line (`repl/handlers.ts`) · skill INDEX clipped per-line in the prompt (`prompt.ts` `trimSkillDesc`) so weak models stop parroting the library. 310 TUI/repl tests green.
- [x] **SCRUB-AI** (M) ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-09 — stripped legacy-agent mentions from published surface (source code, README, ROADMAP, AGENTS.md); kept research docs (`docs/_recon`, `docs/agent-*`, `docs/feature-*`, `docs/platform-*`); branch renamed + merged to main.
- [x] **AUX-MAP** (M) — generalize AUX-VISION into a per-function aux-task → model/provider map (vision · summarize · title · embed), one resolver extending `routing/model-router.ts`. Surfaced in `/status` + a `/aux` command + setup wizard.
- [x] **UX-MODEL-FIX** (S) — *regression.* `UX-MODEL` is marked shipped (picker persists to `.env`, survives relaunch) but model choice is not sticking. Diagnose `setup.ts upsertEnv` + `/model` write path + launcher env precedence. **Done =** pick a model → still active next launch, proven by relaunch.
- [ ] **GOAL→ACTION** (S) — strengthen the headline ask: turn any vague goal into one safe, concrete, verified next action. Infra exists (`repl/next.ts`, `clarify` tool, nd-task-initiation) but is manual; gap = **auto-fire** a `/next`-style single-micro-step prompt on goal-set / vague input. Don't duplicate `next.ts` — trigger it.

**Operator-polish cluster (v2 — mostly strengthen existing infra, not greenfield):** verification discipline (never "done" without tool output) · richer auto-recall of past decisions · lower-friction safe autonomy · clean interrupt + state-preserve + pivot · operator personality (calm/direct, low social tax) · born-small composable artifacts · proactive drift self-monitoring · unified calendar/email/drive/code/web context. Each maps to a partial subsystem (EF gates, brain, comms tools); promote individually when one becomes the bottleneck.

- [x] **DESKTOP** (XL) — desktop app with a chat surface over the kernel/API boundary. The earlier parked disposition is superseded by the shipped desktop surface.

## 2026-06-05 — Operator upgrade backlog (prioritized · "go deep")

Synthesized from improvement dumps + the Vanta Brand Style Guide. **Key truth: most of these already have infrastructure — the work is usually wire / surface / auto-fire, not greenfield.** 105 capabilities shipped in v1; raw coverage is high. The real gap is **operator feel**: initiative, EF scaffolding, memory relevance, visual taste — behaving like a trusted operator, not a capable chatbot.

**Improvement → what Vanta already has → the real gap:**
- **Initiative** → `repl/next.ts` (`/next`), `clarify` tool, nd-task-initiation, EF gates → **auto-fire** on vague/goal-set + stalled-goal detection.
- **Memory** → brain regions (identity/semantic/episodic/user_model/…), capped+pruned `memory/store`, `recall`, curator → **relevance-gated surfacing** + durable-vs-noise classification.
- **Executive function** → EF gates (inhibit/set-shift/self-monitor/closure/research), `/wm` `/where` `/plan` todo store → **persistent task stack** (in-progress/blocked/parked/done) + **loop-closing**.
- **Autonomy** → gateway (cron+webhook+platform poll), factory L1–L4, launchd → **change-watchers** (repos/issues/email/cal) that draft + await approval.
- **Multimodal** → describe_image / look_at_screen / look_at_camera (now aux-routed), transcribe, watch_video → **aesthetic direction** + **compare visual options** (taste, not generic feedback).
- **Code op** → LSP, git tools, run_code, kernel protected-paths → mostly **discipline** (verify-before-claim, smaller patches) → prompt/SOUL.
- **Modes** → `modes/builtin.ts` (6 modes), `/planmode` → the named **build/debug/design/planning/body-double** modes + fast switching.
- **Communication** → SOUL + prompt rules + brand guide voice → **enforce** the direct/literal/operator register.
- **Tool reliability** → EF-ERRORDETECT, errors-as-values → **early fail-detect + safe retry + honest report**.
- **Operator dashboard** → kernel cockpit :7788, status bar, `/goals` `/plan` `/where` → a **unified live dashboard** in the brand dossier aesthetic (left-rail mission-control: goals · plan · blockers · recent · approvals · next move · memory).

### Prioritized sequence (rocks first; Jason's stated biggest = initiative · memory · visual · EF)

**Quick wins (now):**
- [x] **RESTART** (S·sand) — `/restart` slash command: tear down Ink cleanly + re-exec via a launcher loop (exit-code 75 → `run.sh` relaunches), optional kernel respawn. Unblocks the dogfood loop (reload tsx without manually quitting). *(asked explicitly)*
- [x] **TOOL-RETRY** (S·sand) — detect failed tool calls early; retry only when safe (idempotent reads); report exactly what happened. Extends EF-ERRORDETECT.
- [x] **BEHAVIOR-VOICE** (S·sand) — tune `SOUL.md`/prompt to the brand voice (direct, literal, structured, fewer caveats) + harden verify-before-claim. Covers comms (#8) + code discipline (#6).

**Rocks (operator-feel — Jason's stated biggest):**
- [x] **GOAL-ACTION** (S) — auto vague-goal → one concrete next action. *(tracked)*
- [x] **STALL-UNBLOCK** (S·pebble) — detect a stalled active goal → propose the smallest unblocker, unprompted.
- [x] **EF-TASKSTACK** (M·rock) — persistent operator task stack (in-progress/blocked/parked/done) + loop-closing ("I said I'd do X — did X happen?"). Builds on todo store + closure-gate + `/wm`.
- [x] **MEM-RELEVANCE** (M·rock) — classify durable facts vs session noise; surface memory only when relevant, never clutter. Builds on brain + `memory/store` + `recall`.
- [x] **OPERATOR-DASHBOARD** (L·rock) — live surface: goals · plan · blockers · recent actions · pending approvals · suggested next move · memory highlights, in the brand-guide dossier aesthetic (status rail, operation cards, signal colors). Subsumes brand-TUI; the seed for DESKTOP.
- [x] **VISION-COMPARE** (M·pebble) — aesthetic/design direction using operator taste; compare visual options side-by-side, not generic feedback. Builds on the aux-routed vision.

**Parity + modes:**
- [x] **MODES-v2** (M·pebble) — build / debug / design / planning / body-double modes + one-key switching. Extends `modes/builtin.ts`.
- [x] **AUTO-WATCH** (M·pebble) — watchers (repos/issues/email/calendar) → draft action, await approval on risk. Extends gateway/webhook.
- [x] **AUX-MAP** (M) — per-function aux model map. *(tracked)* · **UX-MODEL-FIX** (S) — model-persistence regression. *(tracked)*

**Research (verify before building — expect high existing coverage):**
- [x] **USE-CASE-AUDIT** (S) — map 262 use cases → Vanta's 45 tools → coverage matrix; surface only genuine gaps.
- [x] **CODEBASE-MINE** (M) — targeted read of reference agent codebases for specific stealable patterns (see `docs/feature-audit.md`).
- [x] **INSTALL-PARITY** (S) — setup/install UX parity (one-line `bootstrap.sh` exists; audit the wizard).

**Gated:** SCRUB-AI (run last, force-push gated) · DESKTOP (horizon; OPERATOR-DASHBOARD is its seed).

## Build order — Hermes / OpenClaw parity (2026-06-27)

Execute top-down. Each phase must be green before the next starts.
Target: match Hermes (20+ channels, MOA, streaming, self-learning loop) and OpenClaw (13+ channels, migration importer).

---

### P1 — Stability (ship first, ~2 days)
Bugs that silently break sessions. No new features until these are green.

- [ ] **TOOL-RESULT-MERGE** (S) — merge adjacent `tool_result` blocks in `toAnthropicMessages`. Prevents silent 400s on multi-tool turns with Anthropic. One file change.
- [x] **UX-MODEL-FIX** (S) — model choice persistence regression fixed and tracked by the executable roadmap.
- [ ] **INVALID-JSON-NOTICE** (S) — surface actionable error when a config file (`.vanta/mcp.json`, `.env`) is invalid JSON. Tag `parked/a3f814553d37a522d` — re-port to current main.
- [ ] **DEPRECATED-MODEL-WARN** (S) — warn at session start when the active model ID is a known-deprecated string. Tag `parked/a30937211b2e36851`.
- [ ] **VITEST4** (S) — upgrade vitest past the esbuild advisory (`npm audit fix --force`). Audit test compatibility first.
- [ ] **SETUP-GOOGLE-OAUTH** (setup) — provision Google Cloud OAuth client (`VANTA_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET`). ~30 min. Unblocks all Google comms tools live.
- [ ] **SETUP-BROWSER-BINS** (setup) — `npx playwright install chromium`. One command. Unblocks browser tools.

### P2 — Session & context reliability (~1 week)
Hermes is known for long-session stability. These close that gap.

- [x] **VANTA-TOOL-RESULT-DISK** (S) — oversized tool outputs saved to `.vanta/tool-results/<id>.txt`; context gets a stub reference.
- [ ] **TIME-MICROCOMPACT** (S) — auto-clear tool results older than `VANTA_RESULT_TTL_TURNS` turns. Tag `parked/a8130bd4887679171`.
- [x] **VANTA-SHELL-STALL-DETECT** (S) — watchdog interrupts a hung `shell_cmd` after a configurable timeout and reports elapsed time.
- [ ] **KEEP-GOING-RESUME** (S) — "keep going" resumes prior task; negative-keyword recognition ("stop", "cancel", "nevermind"). Tag `parked/a9499176bf8ac114a`.
- [ ] **COMPACTION-REMIND** (S) — remind the user to `/compress` when context is nearing the limit. Tag `parked/a54f3a6bcaf32c2f7`. Check vs current `context.ts` before re-porting.
- [x] **VANTA-CONTEXT-SUGGESTIONS** (S) — actionable suggestions (what to drop or compact) when context fills.
- [ ] **COMPRESS-FLAGS** (S) — `/compress` focus instructions + `VANTA_DISABLE_COMPACT` gate. Tags `parked/a8130bd…` / `parked/aac5129481d980bab`.

### P3 — Channel parity → Hermes 20+ / OpenClaw 13+ (~2 weeks)
Biggest visible competitive gap. MSG-CHANNEL-PARITY is the umbrella already at the top of this file.

- [x] **MSG-CHANNEL-PARITY** (L) — Discord, Signal, iMessage, Matrix, Teams, Google Chat, email/SMS, and Slack shipped through the `PlatformAdapter` pattern. *(see top of file for full spec)*
- [ ] **PLATFORMS-LONG-TAIL** (demand-driven) — remaining ~19 platforms beyond the umbrella above. Build on explicit request.

---

### P4 — Streaming parity (~1 week)
Hermes streams every provider. Vanta has OpenAI streaming; gaps elsewhere.

- [ ] **STREAMING-PROVIDERS** (M) — streaming (`LLMProvider.stream()`) for all providers. OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini have SSE; Codex, Ollama, OpenRouter need their own paths. Done = every provider streams; no full-completion fallback in a streaming session.

---

### P5 — Self-improvement quality (~1 week)
The "wedge to own" vs Hermes. Closes the loop the raw capability already supports.

- [x] **REFLECT-CORRECT** (S) — post-turn hook detects correction signals and writes structured cross-session reflection.
- [ ] **SECRET-SCANNER-MEMORY** (S) — regex scanner before any `writeRunMemory`/`brain` write; blocks API keys/tokens from landing in memory. Tag `parked/ac637030536a45f69`.
- [x] **VANTA-MEM-FRESHNESS** (S) — inject staleness caveats for older memory.
- [x] **S5 · Heartbeat** (S) — brain selfhood updates wired onto the gateway tick.
- [x] **E-eff2 · Prefer-local routing** (S) — auto-route simple/cheap subtasks to local Ollama; reserve frontier for hard reasoning.
- [x] **VANTA-SELF-LEARNING-LOOP** (L) — one always-on closed loop: observe trajectory → propose skill/edit → eval-gate → adopt → measure reuse. Unifies curator, meta-tune, LoRA, brain. *(see top of file for full spec)*

---

### P6 — MOA: Mixture of Agents (~1 week)
Single biggest quality differentiator vs Hermes. Adds ~6pt lift on hard tasks.

- [ ] **MOA** (M/L) — virtual model provider: N reference models (no tools, trimmed context) run per turn; aggregator synthesizes and acts as the real model. Appears as a normal `/model` selection. Done = `providers/moa.ts`, configurable reference/aggregator pairs in `.env`/`mcp.json`, prompt-cache-safe injection (reference outputs as tail of last user turn). 3–5 days.

---

### P7 — Migration: unlock new users (~3–5 days)
OpenClaw ships an importer. So does Hermes. This is how users arrive.

- [x] **VANTA-MIGRATE** (M) — `vanta migrate openclaw|hermes`: import skills + MCP servers + model config into `~/.vanta`. Preview → select → backup → apply. *(see top of file for full spec)*

---

### P8 — Security & isolation (~1–2 weeks)

- [x] **VANTA-SANDBOX** (M) — opt-in OS isolation for `shell_cmd` + `run_code`. `VANTA_SHELL_SANDBOX=1`.
- [x] **AUTH-BROWSER** (M) — persistent Playwright profile for logged-in browser sessions. Kernel-gated, user-approved on first site.
- [ ] **OAUTH-PKCE** (S) — add PKCE (S256) to `google/auth.ts`. ~4 lines. <1 day.
- [x] **VANTA-PERMISSIONS** (S) — `/permissions` command + pure rule layer for kernel permission rules.

---

### P9 — Extensibility (ongoing, parallel-safe)

- [ ] **LSP-MULTILANG** (M) — extend `lsp_diagnostics`/`lsp_definition` to Rust (rust-analyzer) + Python (pyright). Done = `LSP_LANG=rust|python` works; TS path unchanged.
- [ ] **LSP-DELTA** (S) — LSP diagnostic-delta + `edit_file` tool backed by LSP. Tag `parked/a25c364f2bcccce87`. Check vs current `lsp/` first.
- [ ] **A2A-NETWORK** (L) — HTTP transport slotted behind `A2ATransport` port (`a2a/types.ts`). In-process `A2ABus` stays; HTTP adapter enables cross-machine agent calls.
- [x] **D2 · Skill bundles** (S) — YAML bundle schema: one `/slash` loads a named skill set + instruction.
- [ ] **PROVIDERS-LONG-TAIL** (demand-driven) — ~24 niche providers (Bedrock, DeepSeek, xAI, Qwen, …). Each is a small add via provider registry (A2); build on request.
- [ ] **IMG-GEN-VOICE-REG** (demand-driven) — DALL-E/Whisper provider registries. Build on request.

---

### P10 — UX & polish (post-parity)

- [x] **TUI-KEYS** (S) — readline/Emacs keybindings in the Ink TUI composer.
- [ ] **COCKPIT-RICHER** (M) — richer kernel cockpit at `:7788`. Better goal/approval/event views; brand aesthetic. Seed for DESKTOP.
- [ ] **GOAL-NAMESPACING** (S) — goals scoped per project dir. `vanta goals --project <path>` + `VANTA_GOALS_DIR`.
- [x] **VANTA-COST-GUARD** (S) — real-time cost tracking + configurable hard caps. Surfaced in `/status` + status bar.
- [ ] **RUN-CODE-SANDBOX** (M) — multi-language `run_code` sandboxing (containers or WASM for Python + JS).
- [x] **B-v2 · Emergent self-designed brain** (XL) — Vanta designs its own brain substrate under the kernel boundary.

---

### Horizon (post-users, requires real eval signal)

- [x] **AHE-EVAL-HARNESS** (L) — falsifiable task set + run harness + scored results.
- [x] **AHE-TRACE-DISTILLER** (L) — distill traces into training signal.
- [x] **AHE-SELF-EVOLVE** (XL) — closed self-evolution loop.
- [x] **VANTA-KANBAN** (M) — operator kanban (goals × in-progress × blocked × done).
- [x] **VANTA-BLUEPRINTS** (M) — reusable named workflow blueprints.
- [x] **VANTA-SKILLS-HUB** (M) — browsable, searchable hub for operator-published skills.
- [x] **VANTA-SUGGESTIONS** (M) — proactive suggestions: Vanta notices patterns and proposes next actions unprompted.
- [ ] **MULTI-CRED-POOL** (M) — round-robin credential pool across multiple keys per provider. Build when multi-key rotation is needed.
- [ ] **TRAJECTORY-DATAGEN** (XL) — batch trajectory → ShareGPT JSONL → fine-tuning pipeline. Training infra only; prerequisite: real users + task set.
